art I: IoT Data Encryption Simulation
In the first part of the project, I implemented a simulation of data encryption for an Internet of Things (IoT) device. A Python script was developed to generate virtual sensor readings, such as temperature and humidity, and then encrypt this data using the AES algorithm before transmission.
The purpose of this simulation is to demonstrate how IoT devices protect sensitive data during communication, and to highlight the importance of encryption in preventing unauthorized access.
The script outputs the following:
Plaintext data before encryption
Encrypted ciphertext
Decrypted data after processing on the receiver side
This illustrates the concept of secure communication between an IoT device and a server.

Part II: IoT Device Lifecycle Security Simulation
In the second part of the project, I created a simulation that represents the security stages across the lifecycle of an IoT device. This simulation emphasizes that IoT security is not limited to operation time only, but must be applied throughout all stages of the device’s life—from manufacturing to decommissioning.
The simulated lifecycle includes:
Threat Modeling – Identifying possible risks and vulnerabilities.
Secure Boot – Ensuring the device starts with verified and trusted software.
Key Injection – Securely storing cryptographic keys during manufacturing.
Firmware Integrity Check – Validating firmware updates before installation.
Secure Decommissioning – Removing sensitive keys and data when the device is retired.
This part demonstrates how security is maintained at each step of the device’s lifecycle.

Conclusion
This project focuses on two essential aspects of IoT security:
Securing data transmission through encryption, and
Ensuring device security across its complete lifecycle.
Completing both parts provided a practical understanding of how IoT data is protected and how the security of embedded devices is managed from production to end-of-life.
